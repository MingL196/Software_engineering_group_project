# Software_engineering_group_project

Files:
	push.sh - commands I use to push the program up

	Main.java - start code

	Game.java - main logic

	DB_abstract.java - db abstract
	DB_simple.java	- db logic

	GUI_abstract.java - GUI.java's abstract
	UI.java - main text file println commmands
	GUI.java - Contains 2 classes: GUI, GUI_worker	- INCOMPLETE
		Since GUI is asynchronous, GUI sends out GUI_worker to change
		the GUI, and waits for return value

	default_settings.txt - default settings

To compile: 
	./makejar.sh
To run GUI:
	java -jar triviopoly.jar
	or, if you are on Mac/Windows, double click on triviopoly.jar
To run text version
	java -jar triviopoly.jar 1
	

Change Log:
7-6-2016
Cleanup text version; merge Steve into mine:
	make database class
	change class names
		GUI_interface.java is now GUI.java
		GUI_text_version.java is now UI.java

	move some of the init to top
	make settings file parser (Steve's did not allow change of categories between rounds).

	After considering GUI further, decided to use table to show player info
		should be ok to show all player's info each time.
		as such, main logic can be simplified

	There is no need to have a two dimentional array for questions
		reset at new round instead

	Changed opponent's choice so that it isn't 
		the current player picking a category for the opponent
		but rather
		the opponent       picking a category for the current player
	Also, be careful about currentPlayer+1

	Changed ending to allow multiple winners

7-7-2016
	changed check category finished
	clear message
7-8-2016
	Fixed daily double for 0 money player, opponent's choice validation
	finished GUI
